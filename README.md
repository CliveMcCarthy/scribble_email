# scribble_email
A tool to scribble an email

This program for Linux uses Gtk, Curl, and Jpeg libraries. The program has a very simple UI which allows a stylus to create a handwritten email.

The program has no way to erase writing mistakes -- just scratch things out. You can't change the color of the ink nor can you change the paper. You don't need these things. It's just a scribbled note to a friend.

The table of names and email addresses is embeded in the code. You will need to edit these to suit your needs.
